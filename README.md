disclaimer: if you use this code for anything malicious, unlawful, controversial, or otherwise punishable, its owners and contributors disclaim responsibility (unless one of the owners or contributors are at fault, in which case anyone who wasn't involved are not responsible). we also take no responsibility for you leaking/extracting info or doxxing people with it. that's super uncool.
